# Elastic Container Registry

1. is a "github" like repository that is used to keep docker images.

2. These images can then be used by ECS or Fargate


#### Elastic Container Service

* is a service which allows us to run docker containers.

* With ECS you are responsible for cloud infrastructure which also has 'EC2 Instances'



#### AWS Fargate

* Another service which allows running docker containers

* With Fargate you are not responsible for any infrastructure because it is Serverless

#### Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

* is an open-source system for managing, scaling amd deploying containerized docker applications.

* It is the alternative to ECS (Elastic Container Service)


#### ECS - Task Definition 

* Tasks are the same as docker images
* They are created from task definitions
* A task definition is a type of document which describes the containers characteristics and configurations
